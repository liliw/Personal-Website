            <br>
            &emsp;This project was built on Jupyter Notebook with Python 3, scikit-learn, and numpy, with 60.6% accuracy. The dataset was fetched from
            NBA official website via network packets. Applying with decision tree, 80% of dataset was used as training dataset; 20% dataset was used as test dataset.
            Before starting predicting, the pre-process included generating missing data by the column's mean value, and converting team names
            from string into integer by LabelEncoder.In the decision tree, there are four decision nodes:<br>
              <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-sign"></span> <em>Which team has higher ranking.</em><br>
                  &emsp;&emsp;- It is a general view.<br>
              <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-sign"></span> <em>Which team is home team </em><br>
                  &emsp;&emsp;- Home team usually has more advantages: crowd noise, comfort of being at home, etc.<br>
              <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-sign"></span> <em>Which team won their last match game. </em><br>
                  &emsp;&emsp;- They may have strategies which can against another team. <br>
            &emsp; My next step is implementing a random forest which can improve the prediction accuracy.

            <br>
            &emsp; It was a search engine which provided international visitors travel information of Taiwan. We wrote a PHP web crawler to collect travel information from
            Taiwan Tourism Bureau and a Taiwanese forum, and stored dataset as simple text. With a API which parses Mandarin sentences into elementary words, the elementary words
            were converted into SCV format. <br>
            &emsp; The weights of words/information were given by TF-IDF, and Cosine Similarity. User can retrieve travel information from the huge dataset which
            is stored in our server. However, the calculation speed is terrible due to huge data. To improve the efficiency, we implemented Inverted Index to significantly
            improve the search process.

            &emsp;I read cases and applying proper statistical models to analyze data in R. In the practices, I put my effort on learning how to interpret scatterplots and finding relations
            between attributes. Critical thinking is one of the important skills when a data analyst is trying to explain those parameters. For example,
            when I tried to use a multiple linear regression model to find out the relation which hides under a huge table, I need to explain why these two data contribute to
            this result. <br>

            <br>
            &emsp;The project was designed to eliminate the sole dependency on professor and teaching assistant for course work help. We used Springboot framework for backend,
            MangoDB(no-sql) to build users' class schedules, toturing subjects, toturing review, and toturs' profiles and Angular 4 for for front-end design.
            I was responsible for UX, and responsive front-end design using Angular 4, HTML5 and bootsrap 3. <br>
            &emsp; We employed agile methodology for the project implementation. The course project duration was fixed for 70 days, as a team we decided to have 4 sprint cycles,
            and weekly srcum meeting. I played the role of a scrum master in 2nd sprint cycle and as a product owner in last cycle. This decision was made collectively, we as team belived
            that front-end design is what we will be looked on when we were releasing the product for the class. Since I played a major role in designing front-end, I was given this opportunity.
